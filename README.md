## What is Deoptfuscator

+ Deoptfuscator is a tool for deobfuscating Android applications that have been transformed using control-flow obfuscation mechanisms.
+ Deoptfuscator can reverse the control-flow obfuscation performed by DexGuard on open-source Android applications.

## Prerequisites
In order to build and run deoptfuscator, the followings are required:
+ Deoptfuscator based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64bit PC
  + libboost, libjson (C++ library)
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev  
    $ sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
    ```
  + openjdk
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
    ```
  + i386 libc
    ```
    $ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386  
    $ sudo apt-get update  
    $ sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386
    ```
  + zipalign
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install zipalign
    ```
  + apksigner
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install apksigner
    ```


## HOW TO USE
+ Set Local Environment  
  ``` 
  $. ./launch.sh
  ```
+ Deobfuscate an Android application that has been transformed using control-flow obfuscated techniques.  
  ```
  $ python3 deoptfuscator.py <obfuscated_apk>  
  ```
+ Test our tools!  
  ```
  $ python3 deoptfuscator.py test/Trolly_cf.apk
  ```
  + If the input file (an obfuscated app) was `Trolly_cf.apk`, the file name of the deobfuscated apk is `Trolly_cf_deobfuscated_align.apk`

+ Our tool can effectively deobfuscate Android applications transformed with the control flow obfuscation option of DexGuard :
  + Our tool can currently handle the control-flow obfuscation techniques of DexGuard.
  + It cannot handle other obfuscation techniques such as layout obfuscation, identifier renaming, and string encryption.
